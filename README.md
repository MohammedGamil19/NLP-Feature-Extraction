# 🧠 NLP Feature Extraction: BoW, TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings

This project demonstrates the implementation of three popular **text feature extraction techniques** on a real-world **business news dataset**:

- 🔡 Bag of Words (BoW)
- 📊 TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)
- 🧠 Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)

> ✅ Implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab**  
> ✅ Dataset used: [Global News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/everydaycodings/global-news-dataset) (via Kaggle)
